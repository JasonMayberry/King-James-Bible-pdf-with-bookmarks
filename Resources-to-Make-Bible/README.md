Creating this PDF format of the KJV Bible was a labor of love. What prompted me to make it, you may ask? Isn't the KJV Bible widely available in english? Yes, it can be read online from dozens of websites. Many of which have distracting, constantly changing adds that take away from the simple peace of reading the Bible. Another reason for this format is that it's available when your offline. I searched for the KJV Bible in PDF format and I did find it but the best free one that I could find had small print and only had bookmarks to the book of the Bible. None to the chapters or to the verses. It was only useful for printing in my opinion. I wanted a free Bible.pdf with 2 inch margins for note taking. Lines that are widely spaced and letters of 14pt type and good bookmarks to help find my spot. I just could not find one, so I made one. It contains all the 66 books of the Old Testament and New Testament. I used data found on the internet here: https://github.com/aruljohn/Bible-kjv. Considering the fact that it is an internet Bible I thought it would be fitting to use a preface from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version.
